This is a model api aimed at allowing the user to add models from most of the known model form, Skeleton animation is what is first being worked on.
Then it will go to other models like objs. the aim is to allow the user to create its own loader for whatever file format they want without much if any modifications needed.

The first will be done for Forge 1.12.2 to support the SAO mod. but then I plan on making version that will work on new forge versions, Sandbox and fabric.
